//! S3 bucket lifecycle reconciliation.
//!
//! Backup retention has historically been enforced application-side only:
//! [`super::backup::BackupService::enforce_retention`] sweeps the database
//! and issues `DeleteObject` for each expired backup. That works while
//! temps is running, but leaves a soft failure mode — if the control plane
//! is offline for a week, no S3 cleanup happens and storage costs balloon.
//!
//! This module pushes the same retention policy onto the bucket itself
//! via `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration`. Every backup upload tags the
//! object with `temps-managed=true` + `temps-retention-days=N` (see
//! [`crate::engines::v2_common::BackupTags`]). We then create one
//! lifecycle rule per distinct retention value pointing at that tag
//! filter, so S3 expires the object after N days regardless of whether
//! temps is running.
//!
//! ## Why tag-based filters, not prefix-based
//!
//! Per-schedule prefixes were the obvious first design but would have
//! changed S3 key layout, breaking restore for every existing backup.
//! Tag filters require zero key changes — existing backups (with no
//! tags) are simply invisible to the lifecycle rules; only objects
//! written after this change carry the tags and get expired.
//!
//! ## Provider portability
//!
//! Tag-filtered lifecycle rules are supported by AWS S3, MinIO, OVH
//! Object Storage (High Performance), and RustFS. Cloudflare R2 and
//! Backblaze B2 have rougher support; we treat any provider that
//! rejects the configuration call as "unsupported" and fall back
//! silently to application-side retention — this module never fails
//! the caller because S3 didn't accept a lifecycle rule.
//!
//! ## Reconciliation, not one-shot
//!
//! [`S3LifecycleService::reconcile_bucket`] is idempotent: it computes
//! the desired set of rules from current schedule state and overwrites
//! the bucket's lifecycle config. Drift (manual edits in the AWS
//! console, transient `Put` failures, schedule deletions) is corrected
//! by the next reconcile.
