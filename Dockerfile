# Multi-stage build for Temps with embedded MaxMind GeoLite2 database
#
# Builds the Rust binary, WASM, and Web UI inside Linux/Alpine so the runtime
# artifact always matches the target architecture and musl libc.
#
# Usage: docker build -t temps:latest .

# Selects which stage the runtime copies the binary from: `artifacts-source`
# (default, compiled by the builder stage below) or `artifacts-prebuilt`
# (CI-injected binary from ci-prebuilt/). Declared before the first FROM so
# it can be referenced in a FROM line.
ARG TEMPS_ARTIFACTS=artifacts-source

# Stage 1: Toolchain — everything that depends only on the Dockerfile, not on
# the source tree. Kept as its own stage so CI can cache it as image layers
# (compiling wasm-pack/wasm-bindgen-cli from source dominates a cold build).
# Keep the patch version aligned with the committed CAPTCHA WASM producer.

#
# python3 is required by crates/temps-captcha-wasm's `build`/`build:dev` npm
# scripts, which run scripts/source_attribution.py to annotate the generated
# wasm-pack output — not by anything in this Dockerfile directly.

# Build instructions:
# ==================
# Docker builds the WASM package, web UI, and Rust binary inside its Alpine
# builder. No host toolchain or prebuilt binary is required.
#
# 1. Build the image:
#    docker build -t temps:latest .
#
# 2. Run the container:
#    docker run -d \
#      --name temps \
#      -p 3000:3000 \
#      -p 127.0.0.1:9000:9000 \
#      -e TEMPS_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@postgres:5432/temps" \
#      -v temps_data:/app/data \
#      temps:latest
#
# Environment variables:
# ======================
# - TEMPS_ADDRESS: API server address (default: 0.0.0.0:3000)
# - TEMPS_TLS_ADDRESS: TLS server address (optional)
# - TEMPS_DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
# - TEMPS_DATA_DIR: Data directory (default: /app/data)
# - TEMPS_CONSOLE_ADDRESS: Console API address (optional)
# - TEMPS_LOG_LEVEL: Log level (default: info)
#
# Volumes:
# ========
# - /app/data: Persistent data directory
#   - Stores: logs, encryption keys, and optional runtime databases
#
# Notes:
# ======
# BUILD COMPONENTS:
# - WASM Build: temps-captcha-wasm crate compiled to WebAssembly using wasm-pack
#   Location: Built inside Docker at crates/temps-captcha-wasm/pkg/
# - Web UI Build: Rsbuild frontend application built with bun
#   Location: Built inside Docker at crates/temps-cli/dist/
# - Rust Binary: built natively in Alpine and embeds the generated web UI
#
# GEOLITE2 DATABASE:
# - The tracked crates/temps-cli/GeoLite2-City.mmdb is copied to the immutable
#   /usr/share/temps directory. It remains available when /app/data is an existing
#   persistent volume.
# - GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb is optional and may be mounted under /app/data. It powers
#   hosting/VPS-provider detection used to keep scraper/bot traffic out of the
#   live-visitors view. Without it, that detection is disabled (non-fatal), while
#   city/country geolocation continues to use the bundled city database.
