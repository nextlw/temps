/**
 * Regression coverage for the post-login 404.
 *
 * `/login` is not a registered route: it falls through to `/*` ->
 * ProtectedLayout, which renders the login form in place (leaving the URL as
 * `/login`) and calls `captureReturnTo()`. Before the fix that stored `/login`
 * as the return target, so a *successful* sign-in navigated back to `/login`
 * -- now authenticated, where `AuthenticatedRoutes` has no such route -- and
 * the user landed on "404 - Page Not Found".
 *
 * `bun test` runs without a DOM and return-to.ts only reaches for
 * `window.location` and `window.sessionStorage`, so a small stub is cheaper and
 * clearer here than pulling in a full DOM implementation. It must be installed
 * before the module under test is imported, because the module is evaluated at
 * import time.
