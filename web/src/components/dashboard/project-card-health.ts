/**
 * Health indicator shown on every project card and in the project header.
 *
 * Two independent signals feed this, and the order matters:
 *
 * 1. **Uptime monitors** (`/monitors-health/projects`) — the latest production
 *    status check. This is what "is the project healthy" actually means, and
 *    it has an answer even when nobody visited the site.
 * 2. **User traffic** (`/proxy-logs/stats/projects-health`) — the proxy error
 *    rate over the window. It measures *real user requests* and deliberately
 *    excludes Temps' own monitor checks (`is_system_request = FALSE`), so a
 *    perfectly healthy but quiet project produces zero requests and the
 *    backend reports `"unknown"` because it cannot divide by zero.
 *
 * Reading only (2) is why a project with a monitor sitting at 100% uptime used
 * to be labelled "unknown": its uptime checks were filtered out of the very
 * query being asked, and no human happened to visit in the last hour. Monitors
 * therefore win whenever one exists; traffic is the fallback for projects that
 * have no monitor configured.
 *
 * Whatever the inputs, this never resolves to "render nothing" — "we could not
 * measure it" is itself a state the operator needs to see.
