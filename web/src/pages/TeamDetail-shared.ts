/**
 * What each role actually restricts today.
 *
 * Deliberately not phrased as "read-only" / "full control". Project roles
 * currently narrow a specific set of actions — deploying, environments and
 * environment variables, project settings, custom domains, and deleting
 * the project. Actions outside that set (backups, storage, sandboxes,
 * status pages, error tracking, and so on) are not yet narrowed by the
 * project role and still follow the member's instance-wide role.
 *
 * Describing a role as more restrictive than it is enforced to be is worse
 * than describing nothing, because an operator grants on the strength of
 * the label: "read-only" reads as a safe default for a contractor, and it
 * is not one yet. See ROLE_ENFORCEMENT_NOTE, which is rendered wherever a
 * role is chosen.
